## Project Overview
This project is a clone of the Paytm website. Initially, the website was not responsive, but I have made it fully responsive using **Tailwind CSS**. The website is now optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## What I Have Learned in This Project
- Learned how to use **Tailwind CSS** to make a website responsive.
- Gained experience in managing and styling different `div` elements within the layout.
- Improved my skills with **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid** to create a flexible layout.
- Worked with responsive design principles to ensure the site adjusts well on different screen sizes.
- Enhanced my knowledge of transitioning and animation properties to improve the user interface.

This project took around **10 hours** to complete, including the responsiveness work.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3** 
- **Tailwind CSS** 
- **Font Awesome** 
- **Google Fonts** 
- **Netlify**
